### PURPOSE

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze statistically the temperatures on Oahu during June and December. This in turn helps determine whether the surf and ice cream shop businesses are sustainable year-round. 

### RESULTS

Some of the key differences in weather between June and December are: 
1. Actually there are not that many big temperature differences between June and December. 
2. June: total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0.
3. December: total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0

### SUMMARY

Two queries we can look at are precipitation datapoints and analysis and also we could look at things other than the weather in order to determine whether or not to start a surf or ice cream shop business. (i.e. tide/wave patterns, current profit of ice cream shops in the area, etc.)
